# CWU-CS-109-Final
Quantatative Reasoning using Python (CS 109) Course Final Project Repository.

CIVIPIT (Commonly Identified Viral Illnesses Predicting Intelligent Tool) will be a
program that guesses the closest probable common viral illness (COVID-19, Norovirus (Stomach
flu), Influenza, Common Cold, and RSV) that a user may have depending on their provided
answers to prompts. It will use machine learning algorithms created by us to predict a common
illness that a user may or may not have with fewer questions by training our program to
recognize, use, and write newly recognized patterns using a score-like system. Our group’s team
members will consist of Mario Aguilera, Jakob Greene, and Jacky Njoroge.

To visualize our data, we will use the matplotlib Python library which will allow us to
graph visualizations based on results. This will assist us in outputting bar graphs for the
program’s predictions. Expected outcomes consist of outputting bar graphs that display the
closest possible common illness that the user may have depending on provided input and our
pattern recognition algorithms. Our program’s expected output’s bar graph’s data will be
displayed from left to right in order of most probable to least probable guessed illness that the
user may have, and will rely on pre-made and newly-made datasets that our model will utilize for
faster output.
