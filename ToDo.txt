1. Save result in table then compare the current temporary table with the saved table and overwrite the old table if new dataset leads
    to faster prediction
    2. Example (Data_Saved.txt):
        For data in Data_Saved:
            Data_Line = data.split(',')
            Data_Line = Data_Line.pop(0)
    3. Compare values and determine if there is a pattern of more than 2 similar symptoms. If so, predict the result
    4. Another option (For testing): If program is in testing mode, and user determines the viral illness predicted is wrong,
    then correct the Data
